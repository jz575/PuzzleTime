  Welcome to the end of my little project.
  There were quite a few things I wanted to do but could not do to certain restraints.
  I have no sense of design, so even though I had all the tools I needed to make a great looking website,
  no ideas to act on popped into my head.
  <br><br>
  The Picture section was supposed to be a visual mosaic of pictures, with pictures of statues hidden in pointing at the answer...
  Or something... Time restraints and my lack of design flair led to a fully functional but rather lackluster section.
  The axe being the correct answer is something like a reference.
  Though in reality I would prefer an axe to car keys, keyboard keys, or a gorilla when opening a door.
  <br><br>
  The Number section was a simple subversion, there is not much to say about it.
  <br><br>
  The Shop section was a weird one. I would have added some more joke products with hilariously high prices
  but I stopped myself.
  <br><br>
  There was the hidden cheat button that gave you all the keys without doing the puzzles, those are always fun to think about.
  <br><br>
  Overall, I enjoyed making this website. It was a learning experience and I am glad I tried
  to do something more than formatting text, although one could argue I spent too little time formatting text.
<h2>Once again thank you very much!</h2>
